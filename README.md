# DesignPatternsJava

Tasked with creating a hot beverage machine that offers at least three types of espresso, three types of tea and two condiments, I am including additional options of regular coffee and decaf, because otherwise the machine would be adding condiments to espresso drinks and tea, which most often are served with no condiments. 

This machine is providing coffee free beverages and therefore must be accessed by an exclusive group in a private space, such as Boston University's campus.  The first menu option will ask if the user is a student or faculty member of Boston University, and if not will deny the user a free beverage.
